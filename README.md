# secret seeker
Secret Seeker is a text-based guessing game developed in C using CLI-lib. The objective is for the player to uncover the secret number randomly chosen by the computer within 10 attempts. With each guess, the player receives a hint indicating whether the secret number is higher or lower than their current guess, encouraging strategic thinking and adding a layer of challenge to the gameplay.

## Features
- Random generation of a secret number between 1 and 100
- 10 attempts to guess the secret number
- Hint system to guide the player (higher or lower than the current guess)
- Scoring system that rewards players for fewer guesses
- Tracking of all previous guesses for reference

## How to Play
- The game starts by generating a random secret number.
- Enter a guess; the game will respond with hints to guide you.
- Keep guessing until you find the number or run out of attempts.
- Score is based on the number of remaining attempts after a successful guess.

Enjoy the challenge!
